fuse-google-drive is a fuse filesystem wrapper for Google Drive released under GPLv2

Currently in preliminary development stages.

Status:
	directory listing works, incorrect stat() info
	redirecturi is now hardcoded -- you do not need the file
	clientsecrets and client id should now be in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fuse-google-drive/

Discussion:
	#fuse-google-drive on irc.freenode.net

Dependencies:
	fuse
	curl
	json-c aka libjson
	libxml2

Build Dependencies:
	autotools
	make

Compilation:
	$ ./autogen.sh
	$ ./configure
	$ make

Usage:
	Right now you need to go to http://code.google.com/apis/console and create
a new app and generate a client id and client secret for an install application.
The clientid value and clientsecrets value should each go into:
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fuse-google-drive/clientid
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fuse-google-drive/clientsecrets
resepectively. You should `chmod 700 $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fuse-google/drive` as well.
If the folder does not exist at runtime, a helpful message is printed and the
directory is created with the correct permissions if possible.

	$ mkdir mountpint
	$ ./fuse-google-drive mountpoint
