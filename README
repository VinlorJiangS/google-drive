fuse-google-drive is a fuse filesystem wrapper for Google Drive released under GPLv2

Currently in preliminary development stages.

Discussion:
	#fuse-google-drive on irc.freenode.net

Dependencies:
	fuse
	curl

Build Dependencies:
	autotools
	make

Compilation:
	$ ./autogen.sh
	$ ./configure
	$ make

Usage:
	Right now you need to go to http://code.google.com/apis/console and create
a new app and generate a client id and client secret for an install application.
Place the client secret in clientsecret and the redirect URI in redirecturi in
the same directory as fuse-google-drive. Hopefully a better solution for this
 can be found.

	$ mkdir mountpint
	$ ./fuse-google-drive mountpoint
